# bazel-deps dependency file, declare your maven artifact dependencies in here
# and use bazel-deps to generate a set of Bazel BUILD definitions. bazel-deps
# understands the Scala 2.11 vs 2.12 maven artifact naming convention, so you
# do NOT need to add the "_2.11", "_2.12" extensions to your artifact names.
# See https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps for a description of the file
# format.
